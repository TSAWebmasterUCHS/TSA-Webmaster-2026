    <h1>History of Blairsville, Georgia</h1>

  <article class="history-section">
    <h2>Early Settlement</h2>
    <p>Blairsville, Georgia, was established in 1835 after Union County was created during the Georgia Gold Rush of the early 1830s. Before European American settlement, the area was home to the Cherokee Nation until they were removed during the Trail of Tears. After the land was opened through a lottery system, farmers and gold seekers settled in the region, building homes, churches, and businesses. Blairsville became the county seat and grew into an important mountain community centered on agriculture and local government.</p>
