      <h2>Early Settlement</h2>
      <p>Blairsville, Georgia was established in 1835 after Union County was created during the Georgia Gold Rush of the early 1830s. Before European American settlement, the area was home to the Cherokee Nation, who lived there until they were removed during the Trail of Tears. After the land was opened to settlers through a land lottery system, farmers and gold seekers moved into the region, building small homes, churches, and businesses. Blairsville became the county seat because of its central location, and over time it grew into a small but important mountain community focused on agriculture, trade, and local government.
